1. Linear Scripting Framework :
> This framework is also known as Record and Playback Framework.
> Used to test small size application.
> Creation and execution of test scripts are done individually for each test case.
> Advantages: 
    - Generating test scripts is less time consuming.
    - No prior coding knowledge needed.
    - Fast and easy
> Disadvantages: 
    - Autogenerated scripts cannot be used again as the data is hardcoded.
    - Need to rewrite for different data sets.



2. Modular Testing Framework :
> Tester divide application into multiple modules and create test scripts individually.
> These individual test scripts can be combined to make larger test scripts by using a master script to achieve required scenarios.
> This master script is used to invoke the individual modules to run ene to end scenarios.
> Advantages :
   - Better scalability
   - Individual scripts can be reused
   - Modules are independent and do not rely on each other
> Disadvantages :
   - Takes more time to analyze test cases
   - Identifying reusable flows is hard
   - Need to rewrite for different data sets
   - Requires coding skills 
 

3. Data Driven Framework :
> Data-driven test automation separates test scripts, logic, and data from each other. 
> Automation testing scripts that can run with different parameters being passed to them are created. 
> This test data is kept in external files, e.g., CSV, SQL, or XML.
> This framework significantly reduces the number of test scripts compared to module based framework.
> Advantages:
   - Gives more test coverage with reusable tests.
   - It supports multiple data sets
   - Modules are independent and do not rely on each other
   - It is not hardcoded
> Disadvantages:
   - Require coding skills
   - It takes more time to set up the framework and test data.



4. Keyword Driven Framework :
> It uses a table format to define keywords or action words for each method to execute. 
> Keyword-drive testing is also called table-driven testing or action word based testing.
> Advantages :
  - Code is reusable as the same test scripts can be used for multiple use cases
  - Tests can be designed in advance
  - Test scripts work independently
  - Not dependent on test tools
> Disadvantages :
  - Takes more time to design and requires good test automation skills
  - Setup cost is high


5. Hybrid-driven Testing Framework:

This framework is a mixture of data-driven and keyword-driven testing and can also include any of the frameworks described above. It tries to take the benefits of different structures and combine them to produce a better, more efficient framework.

6. Behavior-driven Testing Framework:

It allows all the parties involved (e.g., the Business Analysts, Developers, etc.) to actively participate in the running of these tests.
